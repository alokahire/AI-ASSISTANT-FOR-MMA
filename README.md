This project introduces an AI assistant designed to enhance the training and performance of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) athletes. By 
analyzing real-time and video-based body movements, the system helps athletes refine their techniques, improve accuracy, and gain a 
strategic advantage over opponents. The assistant analyzes posture, speed, and precise movements to provide actionable insights for
strategy planning. Advanced analytics further optimize performance efficiency during matches. Traditionally, MMA athletes and coaches 
relied on manual methods to analyze fights, such as handwritten notes and limited footage, which often resulted in incomplete or delayed
insights. This system addresses these limitations by automating the analysis process. It uses hybrid model which includes deep learning 
models to detect patterns, techniques, and weaknesses in both the athlete’s and their opponent’s performances and media pipe for pose estimation. 
Real-time feedback during training allows for immediate adjustments, while predictive analytics forecast fight outcomes based on historical data and performance.
The application also focuses on injury prevention by identifying risks like poor technique or overtraining. Personalized feedback helps athletes refine their
movements and adopt better strategies. The system is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring accessibility for athletes and coaches. By integrating video analysis 
with AI-driven insights, this tool bridges the gap between raw data and practical improvements, offering a modern solution to enhance MMA training and competitive performance.
